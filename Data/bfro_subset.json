The reason I remember the date is because I called my mom on that trip to wish her a happy birthday. Driving up the 101 we saw the ave of the giants scenic rout sign so not being in a hurry we took it headed north. Now I'm not sure ot the exact location but between two small towns maybe five miles north of where this gift shop that is actually carved out of a living redwood tree is (I hope that helps) there is a small parking lot off to the right where you can park and walk along some trails that I believe run parallel to the highway. I think the area is intended for day use only. well, we stopped and took a walk down this trail just to take in some of the scenery when about 200 yards down the trail my wife began to get this feeling something was off to the right. I told her it was her imagination when all of a sudden from that direction came this yell or howl that made my skin crawl. It!! started what seemed to be a good distance off in the thick forest and then moved rapidly closer. What startled me was the speed at which the source of the sound traveled. The howl itself sounded halfway between a human voice yelling \"Ahhhhhh\" and the high pitched sound of an elk. It wasn't an elk or human or bear as near as I can tell though and what ever it was moved very fast. We didn't see anything though but we got the distinct feeling weren't welcome in the area. As it seemed to get to what seemed to be around 75 yards away we ran back to the car and promptly left. We never could figure it out so we just dropped the subject. My ex is a superstitious sort and at first started trying to explain it away as a ghost which me want to drop the subject even quicker. But the issue has always unsettled me and when I heard some of the recordings of bigfoot screams on this or some other b.f. website, one in particular was exactly like what I heard that day.

In an area around north sardis lake on public land.I knew I was the only person in there, because of the trails hadnt been used for some time.I rode in about 2 miles in and then walked about 300 yards to where I had hung my climber. It was just about day break, Iwas 20 or so feet up a pine tree when I heard what sounded like someone beating a stick against a tree. I spotted some movement in the area the sound came from,What ever it was was brown and tall,my first thought was its a bear.I was using my binoculars,but it was about 200 yards from me and dawn.So I pulled up my rifle to look threw the scope,hoping I could see it better.It wasnt any bear, it didnt have ears on top of its head and its face was flat. It was at least 8 foot tall and stood like a man.and I noticed its skin was grayish\/green where the hair was thin. I was so startled I stood up.It turned toward my direction and knew I was there.It leaned Its head back as if smelling  the air, then took off. It move 40 or so yards in a few seconds and was gone.I was shaking badly and climbed straight down.I just coundnt beleive what I had seen.So I started walking in the direction I had seen it.I walked over to a hill where it had slid and left a track. It was a human looking foot track.This scared me because I was trying to tell myself, it was just a bear,then a sound came from the woods that sounded like whoop...whoop.So I hurried back got my stand and left those woods. That has been six years ago, and everytime I told anyone my story. They made fun of me, so I been reserved about letting anyone know, but recently.A freind f mine had an encounter,he doesnt want to let anyone know.Because he thinks people will think hes crazy... So I found this web site,and was amazed at how many have seen these things.","National Park Visitation Count":"6587211","Witness Count":1.0,"Multiple Witnesses":false,"BigFoot Hotspot":"FALSE","Forest cover rate":"61.9%"},{"Report Type":"Report","Id":"1345","Class":"Class A","Year":"1998","Season":"Fall","Month":"October","State":"Mississippi","County":"Panola","Date":"15","Time And Conditions":null,"National Park Visitation Count":"6938085","Witness Count":0.0,"Multiple Witnesses":false,"BigFoot Hotspot":"FALSE","Forest cover rate":"61.9%"},{"Report Type":"Report","Id":"8429","Class":"Class B","Year":"2004","Season":"Fall","Month":"March","State":"Mississippi","County":"Pearl River","Date":"31","Time And Conditions":"Approximately 1:00 pm and it was clear and sunny.","National Park Visitation Count":"6938085","Witness Count":3.0,"Multiple Witnesses":true,"BigFoot Hotspot":"FALSE","Forest cover rate":"61.9%"},{"Report Type":"Report","Id":"39764","Class":"Class B","Year":"2013","Season":"Winter","Month":"February","State":"Mississippi","County":"Tishomingo","Date":"17","Time And Conditions":"The time was between 9 PM and 9:30 PM","National Park Visitation Count":"6777673","Witness Count":0.0,"Multiple Witnesses":false,"BigFoot Hotspot":"FALSE","Forest cover rate":"61.9%"},{"Report Type":"Report","Id":"13494","Class":"Class A","Year":"2006","Season":"Winter","Month":"January","State":"Mississippi","County":"Tishomingo","Date":"6","Time And Conditions":"roughly 5pm near sunset","National Park Visitation Count":"6662279","Witness Count":0.0,"Multiple Witnesses":false,"BigFoot Hotspot":"FALSE","Forest cover rate":"61.9%"},{"Report Type":"Report","Id":"40524","Class":"Class A","Year":"2013","Season":"Fall","Month":"March","State":"Montana","County":"Beaverhead","Date":"23","Time And Conditions":"ten thirty in the afternoon","National Park Visitation Count":"2806495","Witness Count":3.0,"Multiple Witnesses":true,"BigFoot Hotspot":"FALSE","Forest cover rate":"20.6%"},{"Report Type":"Report","Id":"17292","Class":"Class A","Year":"2007","Season":"Winter","Month":"January","State":"Montana","County":"Big Horn","Date":"13","Time And Conditions":"11pm or midnight.

if the small one hadnt moved. they were about 40 yds off to my right standing right by a tree. it was a large female about 7-5 ft tall and a little one about 5-5.  she was watching us and when i finally saw her it was very disturbing the smell was that of dead animals, and she stared right through me. i pointed them out to brad and when i did, she took a step in our direction. well we took off running for the house and when we reached the back yard we heard large branches being broken and a long howling like a low pitched airraid siren. it scared the hell out of me.  anyway that weekend i went to my grandparents to get away from there and while i was gone my mother said that something hit the back of the trailer at night which shook the home, and then they heard footsteps running off into the woods, followed by some stange sounds. now i have heard that people say they are not dangerous but i feel they are very capable of doing harm to people and probably will if
